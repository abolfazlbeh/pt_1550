- [x] **Task 4: Build Reveal Seed Screen** ✅  
  Create screen with "hold-to-reveal" button (3-second press), display 12 mock seed words in a numbered grid, add warning message, and "I've written it down" checkbox.

- [x] **Task 5: Build Post-Reveal Checklist Screen** ✅  
  Create screen reinforcing security best practices after reveal: backup verification checklist (written on paper, stored safely, no digital copies), with continue button.

- [x] **Task 6: Build Seed Confirmation Screen** ✅  
  Create screen that randomly asks user to confirm 3 words from their seed phrase (e.g., "What is word #3, #7, #11?") with input fields and validation feedback.

- [x] **Task 7: Build App Lock Screen** ✅  
  Create screen for PIN setup with two 6-digit input fields (create + confirm PIN), add visual biometric toggle option, and validation for PIN match.

- [x] **Task 10: Implement Navigation Flow & Routing** ✅  
  Setup React Router for all screens, implement flow state management, add progress indicator, and connect all screens: Welcome → Explainer → Pre-Reveal Tips → Reveal → Post-Reveal Checklist → Confirmation → Lock → Success → Home.

- Sample seed phrase: `["abandon", "ability", "able", "about", "above", "absent", "absorb", "abstract", "absurd", "abuse", "access", "accident"]`
- Sample validation: Ask for words #3, #7, #11
